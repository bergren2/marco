## Setup
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) is required. It can be installed [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

This project uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) in place of npm. Follow [these instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to install yarn globally.

> Warning: Windows users should not install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) via NPM, instead use the [downloadable](https://yarnpkg.com/latest.msi) MSI executable.

Once installed, yarn is used to install all dependencies.
```bash
yarn install
```

#### Running Locally
```bash
yarn build
yarn start <command>
```

#### Testing
Tests can be run with
```bash
yarn test
```

Additionally, code coverage can be printed at the end of test execution by running
```bash
yarn test:coverage
```

## VSCode Configuration
To ignore folders generated by the `test:coverage` script, add this to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
"files.exclude": {
    ".nyc_output/": true,
    "coverage/": true
}
```

If using [Mocha Sidebar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=maty.vscode-mocha-sidebar) for VSCode, add this to `.vscode/settings.json`:
```json
"mocha.files.glob": "spec/**/*.ts",
"mocha.requires": [
    "ts-node/register",
    "reflect-metadata",
    "spec/support/setup.ts"
]
```
